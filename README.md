# Advanced-NLP for Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we will use **Hugging Face Transformers** and pre-trained **BERT** Neural Networks for sentiment analysis. We will run the model using a single prompt but also leverage **BeautifulSoup** to scrape reviews from Yelp to be able to calculate sentiment on a larger scale.

There are three main steps that we are going to follow:
1. Download and install BERT from HF Transformers
2. Run sentiment analysis Using BERT and Python
3. Scrape reviews from Yelp and calculate the score
